# Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed/Added

### 1. VSCode Configuration (Now Working!)
- ✅ **`.vscode/settings.json`** - Editor settings (format on save, ESLint auto-fix)
- ✅ **`.vscode/extensions.json`** - Recommended extensions

### 2. Local Planning Directory
- ✅ **`.planning/`** directory created
- ✅ **`.planning/README.md`** - Instructions for using this directory
- ✅ **PHASE0_SUMMARY.md** moved from root to `.planning/`
- ✅ **`.gitignore`** updated to exclude `.planning/` from git

### 3. CLAUDE.md Updated
- ✅ Added prominent warning at the top about using `.planning/` directory
- ✅ AI assistants will now know to put planning docs here, not in project root

## Directory Structure Now

```

│   ├── README.md          # Instructions
│   ├── PHASE0_SUMMARY.md  # Phase 0 completion summary
│   └── SETUP_COMPLETE.md  # This file
├── .vscode/               # ← NEW: VSCode settings (committed)
│   ├── settings.json      # Editor config
│   └── extensions.json    # Recommended extensions

```

## Why This Matters

### For You
- `.planning/` keeps your working notes local and private
- No accidental commits of work-in-progress plans
- VSCode settings ensure consistent formatting across the team

### For AI Assistants
- Clear guidance on where to put planning documents
- Won't pollute the repo root with summary files
- Maintains clean public-facing repository

### For Contributors
- VSCode automatically configured with proper settings
- Format on save, auto-fix linting issues
- Consistent development experience

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Run `npm install` to get ESLint and Prettier
2. Run `npm run validate` to check everything builds
3. Start Phase 1 (testing infrastructure)

## Files in .planning/

All files in this directory are local-only and never committed. Feel free to add:
- Meeting notes
- Implementation plans
- TODO lists
- Analysis documents
- Debug notes
- Performance reports
