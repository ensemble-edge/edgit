# Standards Directory

This directory contains development standards, guidelines, and best practices for the project.

## Purpose

Keep your project-specific standards here:

- **Code Review Standards**: Guidelines for reviewing pull requests
- **Architecture Decisions**: ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- **API Guidelines**: Standards for API design
- **Security Standards**: Security review checklists
- **Performance Standards**: Performance benchmarks and goals
- **Testing Standards**: Test coverage requirements and patterns

## Usage

These standards complement the main documentation in the repository root:
- Main docs (CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md) are public and committed
- These standards are internal, local working documents
- Use these for team-specific or evolving standards not yet ready for public docs

## Files in this Directory

- `code-review-standard.md` - Pull request review checklist
- `architecture-decisions/` - ADRs and design decisions
- `security-checklist.md` - Security review requirements
- `performance-targets.md` - Performance benchmarks

All files in this directory are gitignored and local-only.
