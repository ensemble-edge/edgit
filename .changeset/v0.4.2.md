"@ensemble-edge/edgit": patch
---

Make edgit fully standalone by removing ensemble dependency

**Standalone UI Utilities:**
- Created `src/utils/ui.ts` with self-contained CLI output utilities
- Implemented `statusIcons` for consistent status indicators (✓, ✗, ⚠, ℹ)
- Implemented `colors` helper with ANSI escape codes for terminal styling
- Implemented `log` utilities (success, error, warn, info, dim)
- Implemented `banners.edgit()` for branded CLI header

**Dependency Changes:**
- Removed `@ensemble-edge/ensemble` from dependencies
- Updated imports in `commands/base.ts` to use local UI
- Updated imports in `errors/edgit-error.ts` to use local UI
- Updated imports in `index.ts` to use local UI

**Architecture Impact:**
- Eliminates circular dependency between edgit and ensemble
- Allows edgit to be installed and used independently
- Reduces package installation footprint
- Enables independent versioning and release cycles

This patch resolves the circular dependency issue where edgit imported from
`@ensemble-edge/ensemble/ui` while ensemble imported from `@ensemble-edge/edgit/cli`,
which caused npm installation failures in some scenarios.
