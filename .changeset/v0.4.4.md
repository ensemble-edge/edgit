"@ensemble-edge/edgit": patch
---

Add `edgit info` command for comprehensive project status display

- Shows repository state, component counts, recent versions
- Displays deployment status for tracked components
- Supports `--json` and `--compact` output formats for CI/scripting
- `edgit status` now passes through to `git status` (git-native behavior)
